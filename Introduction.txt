AI-assisted CV / Job Description Compatibility – Demo Web Application
====================================================================

This repository contains a demo / reference web application that demonstrates
how AI-assisted tools can support job applicants by comparing a CV
(curriculum vitae) with a job description and estimating their compatibility.

The project was designed as a non-production, educational and portfolio-level
application, focusing on architecture, UX, and modern web development
practices rather than real-world HR decision-making.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Main goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------

• Demonstrate a modern full-stack web application architecture
• Provide a clear, testable demo for CV–job description comparison
• Showcase frontend design, authentication flow, and extensibility
• Prepare the system for future AI-based evaluation using server-side logic

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Key features
--------------------------------------------------------------------

• Authentication handled via Supabase (email/password)
• Demo user support for easy testing without approval flow
• Hungarian / English language switch on the Login and Dashboard pages
• Protected routes (login required for dashboard access)
• Dashboard with:
  – Downloadable demo CV and demo job description (PDF)
  – Text input areas for CV and job description
  – Compatibility score calculation (demo rule-based logic)
  – Highlighted strengths, gaps, and detected keywords
• Clean, responsive UI with a consistent visual design
• Admin role support (extensible, not mandatory for demo usage)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology stack
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
• React
• TypeScript
• Vite
• React Router

Backend / Services:
• Supabase Auth
• Supabase PostgreSQL
• Supabase Storage (for demo PDF files)

Other:
• Simple rule-based scoring logic (keyword matching)
• Prepared for future AI integration (e.g. embeddings, LLM scoring via Edge Functions)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
AI aspect (current state)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The current implementation uses a lightweight, deterministic scoring mechanism
based on keyword overlap between the CV and the job description.
This approach was intentionally chosen to:

• Keep the demo fully client-side
• Avoid exposing API keys
• Ensure predictable, transparent behavior

The architecture is prepared for replacing this logic with:
• Supabase Edge Functions
• Server-side AI model calls (e.g. LLM-based scoring or embedding similarity)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Data protection and privacy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This application is a demo / reference project.

• No real personal data should be entered
• Demo PDFs and demo users are provided for testing
• The system is not intended for real recruitment or decision-making
• GDPR-relevant features (consent, deletion, auditing) are intentionally out of scope

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Intended use
--------------------------------------------------------------------

• Portfolio and reference project
• Technical demonstration for interviews
• Educational example of modern web application design
• Base for further experimentation with AI-assisted HR tools

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The project prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.
All features are intentionally simple and explicit to make the codebase
easy to understand for reviewers and collaborators.
